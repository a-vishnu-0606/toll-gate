Toll payment processing refers to the systems and methods used to collect tolls from vehicles using toll roads or bridges. Toll roads and bridges are an important part of the transportation infrastructure, providing a means for vehicles to travel long distances quickly and efficiently. However, the use of these facilities comes at a cost, and tolls are collected to cover the cost of construction, maintenance, and operation of the road or bridge. Toll payment processing is a critical aspect of the operation of toll roads and bridges, as it ensures that tolls are collected accurately and promptly, and that the toll collection process is efficient and convenient for users.
Many toll payment processing systems also include features such as account management, violation enforcement, and customer service. For example, an account management system allows users to view their account information, make payments, and update their contact information. Violation enforcement systems are used to identify and track vehicles that have not paid their tolls, and customer service systems provide assistance to users with questions or issues related to their toll payments.
Overall, toll payment processing is a complex and multifaceted process that requires the integration of various technologies and systems. Its goal is to make the toll collection process as efficient and convenient as possible for users, while also ensuring that tolls are collected accurately and promptly.
# OPERATION PERFORMED ON TOLL GATE PROCESSING:
Simulates a toll plaza system where a user enters their vehicle type, number, starting place, and destination place. The program then displays this information and calculates the total toll price based on the number of toll gates crossed and the type of customer (normal or VIP). The user is prompted to enter the price of each toll gate and the program keeps a running total. If the user selects VIP customer type, the program applies a 20% discount to the total toll price. The program continues to run until the user selects the "exit" option.  

# PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The main class, "TollGateFile", extends the javafx.application.Application class and overrides the "start" method. It creates a JavaFX window with a title "Toll Gate" and a VBox layout. The main method creates a FileWriter object and writes to a text file called "newfile.txt" on the user's desktop.
It defines a class "TollFile" that has properties for the vehicle number, starting place, and destination. The class has a display method that prints the properties and a constructor that sets the values for the properties. The class also has a method called "cal" which calculates the total price of the toll for the vehicle. It takes input from the user for the number of toll gates crossed and the price of each toll gate, and then calculates the total price based on that input. The user also has the option to input if they are a normal customer or a VIP customer, which affects the final price.
The code also includes a button, which when clicked increments a buttonClickedCount variable and writes the count to the text file. Finally, the start method launches the application and the FileWriter is closed in a finally block.
The code imports several classes from the JavaFX library, including the Application class, which is used to launch the JavaFX application, and various layout and control classes for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application. It also imports some classes from the java.io package for reading and writing to files, and the java.util package for using the scanner class to take user input.
